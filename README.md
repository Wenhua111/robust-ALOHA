1. Before launching robust-ALOHA, make sure that GPU is properly installed in your machine, and please modify compile_gpu.m in folder 'bin'
2. Then, just start main.m file for random-valued-impulsive-noise in grey image.

*note : these codes mainly ran on Matlab 2016a with GPU TITAN X (architecture : Maxell)
